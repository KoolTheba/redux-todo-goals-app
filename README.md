# redux-todo-goals-app
Todo/Goals application made with 💜  and Redux 🏆 

> Release v1.0.0. Sept' 2020 💪

> Release v1.0.1. Sept' 2020 💪 (deploy a React app in GitHub pages)

> Release v1.0.2 Oct' 2020 🏆 (created and added new api that provides data persistance new feature)

## Data persistance feature (new! 🥳)
🚀  I have completely refactored the api, and created a new one, with support to localstorage, so now you get data persistance for free! 😎
> 👉 Check my home-baked api [todos-goals-localsotrage](https://www.npmjs.com/package/todos-goals-api-localstorage) in npm

## What is it and what can I do with this app?
Its name doesn't lie! This app is meant to keep your todos and goals in a cute list with which you can interact.
Once running in your localhost, you can:
- ➕ Add a todo or a goal to an individual list
- 🚫 Remove the selected todo or goal
- ✅ Toggle a todo (only) in case you want to make it available again, instead of removing it
